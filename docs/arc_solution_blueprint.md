# ARC Prize 2025 Solution Blueprint

## 1. Design Goals
- **易用性（Usability）**: Provide modular interfaces so researchers can plug in new solvers, visualize tasks, and run experiments without extensive setup.
- **可视化（Visualization）**: Offer rich, interactive views of ARC grids, transformation hypotheses, and solver execution traces.
- **健壮性（Robustness）**: Ensure pipeline stability via validation, fallback strategies, and reproducible experiment management.
- **逻辑清晰（Logical Clarity）**: Maintain explicit reasoning flows and data lineage for every prediction.
- **数学原理清晰（Mathematical Transparency）**: Ground each solver component in well-understood mathematical abstractions and provide documentation that ties algorithms to theory.

## 2. System Architecture Overview
1. **Task Loader**
   - Parses Kaggle JSON files into normalized `GridTask` objects.
   - Validates schema and grid sizes; emits structured warnings when anomalies are detected.
2. **Knowledge Base of Primitives**
   - Library of **mathematical operators** (group actions, morphological transforms, combinatorial search) wrapped as reusable `Primitive` classes.
   - Each primitive documents its theoretical background (e.g., affine transforms, graph searches) and exposes introspection hooks.
3. **Hypothesis Engine**
   - Generates candidate transformation programs by composing primitives under constraints (symmetry, color invariants, topology).
   - Uses **type-directed search** with pruning heuristics derived from information theory (e.g., minimum description length) to manage combinatorial explosion.
4. **Executor & Verifier**
   - Executes candidate programs on train examples, checks consistency, and ranks hypotheses using Bayesian scoring over error likelihoods.
5. **Visualization Suite**
   - `TaskBoard` dashboard (Plotly Dash or Streamlit) for comparing inputs, intermediate grids, and outputs.
   - Supports animation of sequential operations and overlays showing cell-wise differences.
6. **Experiment Orchestrator**
   - CLI commands for running batches, logging metrics, and exporting submissions.
   - Integrates with `wandb`-style logging (offline mode) to track hypothesis success rates and solver ablations.

## 3. Mathematical Foundations
- **Group Theory & Symmetry**: Model color permutations, rotations, reflections as group actions on grids, enabling canonicalization and invariant detection.
- **Combinatorics**: Use set partitions and counting arguments to detect repeated motifs and deduce tiling patterns.
- **Graph Theory**: Represent grids as adjacency graphs to extract connected components, shortest paths, and boundary structures.
- **Information Theory**: Apply description length minimization to select parsimonious hypotheses.
- **Linear Algebra**: Leverage matrix operations for convolution-like filters, rank analyses, and affine mappings.

Each primitive references its mathematical derivation in docstrings and documentation; proofs or derivations are linked to the user manual.

## 4. Usability & Interface Plan
- Package the code as a Python module (`arc_solver`).
- Provide `pip`-installable dependencies via `requirements.txt` and lock files for Kaggle.
- Document notebook templates for Kaggle submissions, including CPU/GPU toggles.
- Offer configuration YAML files to specify solver stacks and search budgets.
- Add CLI commands:
  ```bash
  arc run --task-id <id> --budget medium
  arc visualize --task-id <id>
  arc submit --input arc-agi_test_challenges.json --output submission.json
  ```
- Supply quick-start tutorial notebooks with guided explanations.

## 5. Visualization Strategy
- Build a `GridVisualizer` class using Plotly for interactive heatmaps and animations.
- Implement `HypothesisTrace` objects that log intermediate grids; render them as step-by-step carousels.
- Allow exporting visualizations to static PNGs or GIFs for reports.
- Embed a lightweight HTML report generator summarizing:
  - Task metadata
  - Top hypotheses with scores
  - Before/after comparisons

## 6. Robustness Measures
- **Schema Validation**: Strict checks when loading tasks; failing tasks fall back to safe defaults while logging errors.
- **Unit Tests**: Cover primitives, hypothesis generation, and submission formatting.
- **Property-Based Tests**: Use `hypothesis` to fuzz grid operations and ensure invariants (e.g., rotations preserve color counts).
- **Graceful Degradation**: If advanced solvers fail, fall back to baseline heuristics (e.g., copy input, majority fill) for at least plausible predictions.
- **Resource Guards**: Timeouts and budget caps prevent runaway searches.

## 7. Development Roadmap
1. **MVP Baseline (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Implement task loader, basic primitives (color counting, symmetry detection), simple search, and submission writer.
   - Create minimal visualization notebook and CLI skeleton.
2. **Robust Solver Expansion (Weeks 3-6)**
   - Add graph-based primitives, pattern matching, and MDL scoring.
   - Integrate property-based tests and continuous integration.
3. **Visualization & Usability Enhancements (Weeks 5-7)**
   - Finalize dashboard, reporting, and offline logging.
   - Prepare tutorial notebooks and documentation.
4. **Optimization & Ensemble Strategies (Weeks 6-9)**
   - Incorporate neural-guided search or meta-learning to prioritize primitives.
   - Run large-scale evaluations on validation set.
5. **Finalization (Weeks 9-10)**
   - Polish documentation, release notebooks, and ensure reproducible Kaggle submissions.
   - Generate final presentation materials (reports, visualizations).

## 8. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
- Maintain a `docs/` directory with:
  - **User Guide**: Step-by-step instructions with screenshots.
  - **Mathematical Appendix**: Derivations and proofs for each primitive.
  - **API Reference**: Auto-generated via Sphinx or MkDocs.
- Encourage collaborative note-taking via Markdown RFCs for new solver ideas.

## 9. Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- **Search Space Explosion**: Address with typed primitives, heuristic ordering, and caching of intermediate results.
- **Overfitting to Validation Tasks**: Use cross-validation on training splits and track performance on hold-out sets.
- **Visualization Performance**: Optimize rendering with downsampling and caching; allow headless export on Kaggle.
- **Complexity Management**: Enforce coding standards, linting, and modular architecture to keep logic traceable.

## 10. Success Metrics
- Leaderboard accuracy compared to baseline.
- Time-to-first-solution for new tasks.
- User satisfaction measured via internal surveys (ease of extending solvers, clarity of docs).
- Coverage of mathematical documentation (percentage of primitives with derivations).

This blueprint aims to balance innovative reasoning approaches with practical engineering so the team can iterate quickly, understand solver behavior, and communicate results effectively.
